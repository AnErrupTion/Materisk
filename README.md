# Spaghetto
Spaghetto is a simple interpreted language with an interpreter written in C#

## V2
V2 is a new iteration of spaghetto, written completely from scratch. The syntax has been slightly changed to allow for easier and better parsing whilst maintaining an easy to use syntax. V2 aims to be faster, less buggy and more usable. Also, I am planning to never use Reflection within this project so that it stays compatible with COSMOS, if that isn't possible in the long run, I will probably create a cosmos-compat branch at some point.

## Why use Spaghetto?
Honestly, you shouldn't. It is just a fun project I do in my free time. It isn't really good, stable or quick. Its slower than python. Worse than COBOL (ok thats maybe over exaggerated). Has more bugs than Cyberpunk 2077.

## How do I use Spaghetto?
Download the latest release and extract it. Run spaghetto.exe (you might need to install .NET 6.0 first). This will open a command prompt allowing you to enter single line
Spaghetto instructions. To run multi-line instructions, use the run(path: String) command.

## Documentation
Coming soon, whilst the docs are work in progress, you can check the examples in [/spaghetto/examples/](https://github.com/GoldenretriverYT/spaghetto/tree/main/spaghetto/examples)

## Credits
The core of this language is based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg) as I would have been to stupid to do this properly otherwise (like seriously, look at [PoopScript](https://github.com/GoldenretriverYT/PoopScript) to see what a mess I used to make)

**V2 UPDATE**: This above statement is no longer true, it is fully written from scratch and does not feature weird bugs and quirks because it was translated from python!

(this is not implying that this one is good lmao, it really isnt)
